# Project Readme

## Description

This project utilizes the **ETA.js** template engine to render HTML pages and fetch data from the **Bored API** to display random activity suggestions to users.

ETA.js is a lightweight and powerful template engine that allows us to separate the HTML structure from the data and efficiently render dynamic content on the client-side.
## Features

- **ETA.js Templating**: ETA.js allows us to create modular templates and populate them with dynamic data fetched from the Bored API, resulting in a seamless user experience.
- **Bored API Integration**: The application fetches random activity suggestions from the Bored API and displays them on the website in an appealing format.
- **Responsive Design**: The web application is designed to be responsive and compatible with various devices, ensuring a consistent user experience across desktop and mobile platforms.
